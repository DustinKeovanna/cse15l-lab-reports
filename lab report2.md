For image 1, the method I used was handlerequest. 

The relevant argument is a URL and checks if it contains ```/add-message```. If it does The message is added to a string array and returned to the browser. The Variable, ```Message``` is returned and the value is the previous message with the string formatted int of ```num```. 

The values do not change or differ, because the argument converts the input into a string, regardless of if it is an int or double.
